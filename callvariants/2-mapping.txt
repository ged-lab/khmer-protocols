2. Mapping reads to the reference genome
========================================

Index the reference genome
--------------------------
First step in mapping reads is to generate an index for the reference genome.

The reference genome for our example is the Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome H37Rv. 

.. shell start

.. ::

   set -x
   set -e


We will be using bowtie2 to map the reads to this reference genome. So lets index the reference genome using bowtie2-build.

.. note::
   bowtie2-build -f <reference_genome.fa> <basename>

Copy your reference genome fasta file to the directory where your fastq files are (/data/) and also working directory (/mnt/work). Alternatively, you can create a new directory for the reference, build reference index (see below), and add this directory to the BOWTIE2_INDEXES environment variable.

Create the index as follows:
::

   bowtie2-build -f H37Rv.fa H37Rv

where, H37Rv is the basename that is now assigned to the index files. The reference index files created are:

H37Rv.1.bt2  H37Rv.3.bt2  H37Rv.rev.2.bt2
H37Rv.2.bt2  H37Rv.4.bt2  H37Rv.rev.1.bt2


Link in your data
-----------------

Make sure your data is in /mnt/work/.  You can do::

   cd /mnt
   mkdir -p work
   cd /mnt/work
   ln -fs /data/*.qc.fq.gz .

Map reads to genome
-------------------

Since we are using bowtie2, map the reads to the reference using this command:

.. note::
   
   bowtie2 -x <reference_basename> -1 <'_1.pe.qc.fq' file> -2 <'_2.pe.qc.fq' file> -U <'.se.qc.fq' files> -S <SAM output file>

First pair of the paired-end reads go after "-1" in a comma separated format, the second pair of paired-end reads go after "-2", and any unpaired/orphan reads go after "-U", again in comma separated format. The output SAM filename is provided after "-S". Notice that:

1. The .fq.gz files have to be uncompressed to .fq. This can be done using 'gunzip -c '.fq.gz' > '.fq'. If your files are huge and you do not want to uncompress them, you can use zcat (short for gunzip -c) as follows:

bowtie2 -x <reference_basename> -U <( zcat '.fq.gz' ) -S <outfile name>

i.e., the .fq.gz filename should be replaced by '<( zcat .fq.gz )'.

2. If you are supplying paired-end reads via flags "-1" and "-2", the number of reads in the paired files should be exactly the same.

Lets run bowtie2 on our example dataset!

::

   bowtie2 -x H37Rv -1 SRR671851_1.pe.qc.fq -2 SRR671851_2.pe.qc.fq -U SRR671851_1.se.qc.fq,SRR671851_2.se.qc.fq -S SRR671851_mapped.sam

Notice that the orphan .se.qc.fq files are supplied under the "unpaired" -U flag. I see the following output:

99795 reads; of these:
  97259 (97.46%) were paired; of these:
    1844 (1.90%) aligned concordantly 0 times
    93516 (96.15%) aligned concordantly exactly 1 time
    1899 (1.95%) aligned concordantly >1 times
    ----
    1844 pairs aligned concordantly 0 times; of these:
      481 (26.08%) aligned discordantly 1 time
    ----
    1363 pairs aligned 0 times concordantly or discordantly; of these:
      2726 mates make up the pairs; of these:
        1601 (58.73%) aligned 0 times
        746 (27.37%) aligned exactly 1 time
        379 (13.90%) aligned >1 times
  2536 (2.54%) were unpaired; of these:
    36 (1.42%) aligned 0 times
    2402 (94.72%) aligned exactly 1 time
    98 (3.86%) aligned >1 times
99.17% overall alignment rate

It looks like the reads mapped! Success! Now lets find out the SNPs in the mapped reads.
