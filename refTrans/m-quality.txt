Short read quality and trimming
===============================

.. shell start

It is time to run your Tmux session and it is a good trend to do this from your root directory::

   cd ~
   tmux

Now, the remote computer will sustain your jobs even your ssh connection was interrupted.
You can always restore your tmux session by going to your root directory and type "tmux attach"


Assessment of sequence quality (FastQC)
---------------------------------------

We're going to use `FastQC <http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/>`__ to summarize the data. 
FastQC operates on Fastq files as well as GZip compressed Fastq (.gz) files.

.. note:: This section reuires FastQC/0.11.2 installed

Now run FastQC on your sequencing file
::
   
   cd $workingPath
   mkdir rawData_fastqc
   fastqc *.fq.gz --outdir=$workingPath/rawData_fastqc

.. .. note:: When you pass multiple files to FastQC, it operates one file at a time give it a seprate output.


Now type 'ls' in the output directory to explore the result files::

   ls $workingPath/rawData_fastqc

and you will see ::

   salivary_repl1_R1_fastqc.html
   salivary_repl1_R1_fastqc.zip
   ...

In the root of your terminal, you can copy these files to your laptop and open them in a browser

For HPCC::

   scp <username@hpc.msu.edu>:<workingPath>/rawData_fastqc/salivary*fastqc.* /tmp
   
For Amazon::
   
   scp -i <ec2key.pem> ubuntu@<IP or DNS alias of the instance>:/path/to/file .

and then open the html files in your browser.

Trimming of low quality bases (Trimmomatic)
-------------------------------------------

Now we're going to do some trimming to remove any leftover adaptor sequences and low quality trailing edges. 
We'll be using `Trimmomatic <http://www.usadellab.org/cms/?page=trimmomatic>`__.
For a discussion of optimal RNAseq trimming strategies, see `MacManes, 2014 
<http://journal.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fgene.2014.00013/abstract>`__.

.. note:: This section reuires Trimmomatic/0.32 installed

To run Trimmomatic
::

   cd $workingPath
   for f in *R1*.gz; do
        input_R1="$f"
        input_R2=$(echo "$f" | sed s/R1/R2/)				                
        output_R1_PE=$(echo "$f" | sed s/R1/R1.pe/)
        output_R1_SE=$(echo "$f" | sed s/R1/R1.se/)
        output_R2_PE=$(echo "$f" | sed s/R1/R2.pe/)		
        output_R2_SE=$(echo "$f" | sed s/R1/R2.se/)		
        java -jar $TRIM/trimmomatic PE $input_R1 $input_R2 \
    $output_R1_PE $output_R1_SE $output_R2_PE $output_R2_SE \
    ILLUMINACLIP:$TRIM/adapters/TruSeq3-PE.fa:2:40:15 \
    LEADING:2 TRAILING:2 \
    SLIDINGWINDOW:4:15 \
    MINLEN:25 &>> log.txt
   done
   
..     # Titus workshop: ILLUMINACLIP:$TRIM/adapters/TruSeq3-PE.fa:2:40:15 LEADING:2 TRAILING:2 SLIDINGWINDOW:4:2
..     # my  parameters: ILLUMINACLIP:$TRIM/adapters/TruSeq3-PE.fa:2:30:10:1 SLIDINGWINDOW:4:15


Now type 'ls' in the output directory to explore the result files::

   ls *.fq.gz

and you will see ::

   salivary_repl1_R1.fq.gz
   salivary_repl1_R1.pe.fq.gz
   salivary_repl1_R1.se.fq.gz
   salivary_repl1_R2.fq.gz
   salivary_repl1_R2.pe.fq.gz
   salivary_repl1_R2.se.fq.gz
   ...

Trimming of paired end reads in four output files for each pair input files.
The two output files labeled with (.pe) represnt the reads that are still in the pair end format. 
The other two files labled with (.se) represent the unpaired reads remaining from one input file 
after dropping the corresponding read from the second input file. 

You can check the log file to see how much the trimming affected the data.

For better understanding of the Trimmomatic parameters, you need to check 
`Trimmomatic web page <http://www.usadellab.org/cms/?page=trimmomatic>`__ . 
You might need to teak these parameters for you own data

.. * Are parameters different for RNAseq and genomic?
.. * What do we do with the single-ended files (s1_se and s2_se?)

FastQC again
------------

Run FastQC again
::

   mkdir trimmedData_fastqc
   fastqc *.pe.fq.gz --outdir=$workingPath/trimmedData_fastqc


Now you can dowload the output files and check for changes after Trimmomatic treatment

.. * Does it matter that you still have adapters!?

.. shell stop
