High Performance Computation 
============================

During the last few years, Next generation sequencing (NGS) has become widely available and cost effective. 
The tremendous amounts of data generated by NGS are fundamentally changing how research is done. 
However, these huge amounts of data requires dedicated software and special computation resources.
High Performance Computaters are tyically used for this kind of data analysis.

We adapted this protocol to run on 2 examples of those computers

Using either system, you need to communicate from your local machine to run your job on a distant server.
We use `SSH client <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_SSH_clients>`__ to do this job. 
A problem that you have to be aware of is that when you log out of the communication session, 
whatever the job you are running on the distant computer will stop. Some of our jobs should take hours and may be days 
and it will be too frustrating to start over each time you lose the connection with the server.
So. We need a way to trick the server to continue our jobs even if we are not logged in. 
Couple softwares do that, for example `Tmux <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tmux>`__. 
Tmux will let us begin a session and detach from it, letting it run by itself.
