Counting the reads that map to each feature
===========================================

After mapping of reads back to the transcriptome. Now it is time to figure out 
the expression level of each expression unit. There is two main flavours of this process:

   :maxdepth: 2

   m-htseq
   m-cufflinks

Simply count all the reads that map **uniquelly** to all exons of the gene. There are several 
software packages that can do this e.g. 
`htseq-count <http://www-huber.embl.de/users/anders/HTSeq/doc/count.html>`__.
and `Featurecount <http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/featureCounts/>`__.
Both programs require the user to provide a gene model (Gene annotation file; GTF).
Annotaions file of model oraganisms are avaliable on all gene banks (e.g. 
`NCBI <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/guide/howto/dwn-genome/>`__, 
`UCSC <http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/downloads.html>`__, and
`Ensemble <http://www.ensembl.org/info/data/ftp/index.html>`__). 
Also they are avaliable through other genomic software projects e.g. 
`Illumina iGenomes project <http://cufflinks.cbcb.umd.edu/igenomes.html>`__.

Mapping the reads to transcripts (gene isoforms) rather than the whole genes will enable 
the identification of changes in alterative splicaing machinary. Alternative splicing is believed to be 
one of the most powerful regulatory mechanisms in severel biological conditions including 
`cancer <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24336324>`__, 
`development <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24752171>`__,
`immmunology <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23550649>`__, 
`fertility <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25474150>`__, and many others.

`Cufflinks <http://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/cufflinks/>`__ is the canonical software 
package to do that. But there are other softwares for analysis of differential 
splicing events (exon skipping, intron retention, etc.) 
e.g. `MATS <http://rnaseq-mats.sourceforge.net/>`__, and 
`MISO <http://genes.mit.edu/burgelab/miso/>`__.

Cufflinks also 
pools the results of all transcripts per gene to give an answer similar to the one obtained from 
htseq-like packages. One comparative feature that should be considered is the tendency of Cufflinks to 
utilize ambiguously aligned reads (versus htseq wich use anly the uniquelly mapped reads). 
This feature might explain a lot of the differences in the output of the 2 softwares.

Cufflinks can do the mapping based on the avaliable annoataion files which will 
make Cufflinks operate on the known transcripts only. However Cufflinks can make 
its own gene model. This feature has two inportant applications:
* Prediction of denovo transcripts of known genes which is a valid possibility even in well annoatated oraganisms.  
* Prediction of novel genes. This feature is very helpful for semi-model organisms that does not have a well annoatated transcriptome.
On the other hand, mapping to transcripts requires the implementation of error prone modeling 
approaches and thus requires rigorous laboratory confirmation.
