Counting the reads that map to each transcript
==============================================

.. shell start

Now that we know which reads go with which gene, we'll use
`Cufflinks <http://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/cufflinks/>`__ to allocate those reads
to the possible transcripts of every gene

.. note:: This section reuires cufflinks/2.1.1 installed

You can ask Cufflinks to use only annotated transcripts by the argument (--GTF). 
However there is another argument (--GTF-guide) which Tells Cufflinks to use the 
supplied reference annotation to guide reference annotation based transcript assembly.
Output will include all reference transcripts as well as any novel genes and isoforms that are assembled.

As we discussed before, Cufflinks uses the ambiguously aligned reads in its calculation.
To do this in a more conservative approach, there are several arguments that you can pass to Cufflinks:
1. --multi-read-correct                 Tells Cufflinks to do an initial estimation procedure to more accurately weight reads mapping to multiple locations in the genome
2. --frag-bias-correct <genome.fa>      Providing Cufflinks with a genome reference to run a bias detection and correction algorithm which improve accuracy of transcript abundance estimates. 

::

   for f in *_tophat; do
        cufflinks \
            --GTF-guide "$GTF_file" \
            --multi-read-correct \
            --frag-bias-correct ${homo_sapiens_genome} \
            --num-threads 4 \
            --output-dir $f/cufflink_out \
            $f/accepted_hits.bam
   done

Out folder will have four files::

   transcripts.gtf        : This GTF file contains Cufflinks' assembled isoforms.
   isoforms.fpkm_tracking : This file contains the estimated isoform-level expression values  
   genes.fpkm_tracking    : This file contains the estimated gene-level expression values        
   skipped.gtf            : List of skipped loci. Cufflinks skip a locus if more than 1000000 fragment
                            mapped to it. You can change this through the (-max-bundle-frags)  

Note, Cufflinks express the expression values in **FPKM** (Fragments per kilobase of exon per million reads mapped). 
This unit corrects for the gene size and the depth of sequencing. So let us say that the expression of a given gene was 100, 
this means that for every one million fragments(read if single ended or pair if paired ended) 
mapping to the whole transcriptome, 100 fragments of this million will map to one kilobase of this transcript.

Because we have multiple RNA-Seq libraries, It is recommend that you merge these assemblies into a master transcriptome. 
This step is required for a differential expression analysis of the new transcripts we've assembled. 
`Cuffmerge <http://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/cufflinks/cuffmerge/index.html>`__ performs this merge step.

First step is to specify all the input GTF files in a **manifest** file listing full paths to the files.
::

   for f in *_tophat; do
        echo $workingPath/$f/cufflink_out/transcripts.gtf >> assembly_GTF_list.txt
   done

Now we can run the cuffmerge software
::

   cuffmerge \
        --ref-sequence ${homo_sapiens_genome} \
        --ref-gtf $GTF_file \
        --num-threads 4 \
        assembly_GTF_list.txt

The cuffmerge will output a folder called "merged_asm" which contain "merged.gtf" file 
containing all the transcripts that cufflinks had assembled. Cuffmrege has an optional argument
(--ref-gtf) which allow you to pass the reference annotation. Therefore, the merged.gtf has cufflinks
transcripts with their matching reference transcripts.
