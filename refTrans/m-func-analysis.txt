Functional and network analysis on differentially expressed genes
=================================================================

There are a number of sites that let you analyze gene lists, including
`DAVID <http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/>`__.  I have gotten a number of
recommendations for `PANTHER <http://www.pantherdb.org/>`__.  PANTHER
lets you upload gene lists and explore their functional categories
interactively or in a gene list/annotation format.

More specifically, you can explore your RNAseq data with

* functional classifications, in pie chart or in list;
* tests for statistical overrepresentation;
* tests for statistical enrichment based on associated fold change.

You need to crop and transform the data a little bit before using the
functional classification.  The steps are:

1. Download `the CSV file <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ngs-docs/2014-msu-rnaseq/master/files/subset/edgeR-lung-vs-salivary.csv>`__.  If you've produced your own, copy it over from the HPC.

2. Open it in Excel.

3. Choose an FDR cutoff (suggest FDR < 0.05 or lower) and delete all the rows after that (or, copy the rows into a new spreadsheet -- might be quicker).

4. Save as a "Tab-delimited text."  (Note, on Mac OS X, you may need to save this as "Windows formatted text" instead.)

This is now a file you can upload to PANTHER.

(`You can download my copy of this here <http://2014-msu-rnaseq.readthedocs.org/en/latest/_static/subset/edgeR-panther-upload.txt>`__)

To do the analysis, go to http://www.pantherdb.org/. In box 1, select "Choose file"
and find the CSV file you want to upload to PANTHER.  Nothing else in box
one should be changed.

In box 2, select "Homo sapiens."

In box 3, select either "Functional analysis classification viewed in
gene list" or "Functional analysis classification viewed in pie
chart."

Click submit.

Now you can explore the results!
