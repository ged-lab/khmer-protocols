Differential expression by Cuffdiff
===================================

.. shell start

We'll be using `Cufdiff
<http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/edgeR.html>`__
to do the differential expression analysis based on the cufflinks output.

define the groups you want to compare (According to our sample naming conventions, 
it should be exactly matching the stating name of your samples)
::

   groups=(lung salivary)
   
Cufflinks recive replicates as comma separated lists for each condition.    
You can write those lists yourself but we can also create these lists 
and store them in an array.
::

   gp_replicates=()
   for gp in "${groups[@]}"; do
        replicates=()
        for rep in $gp*_tophat; do
            replicates+=("$workingPath/$rep/accepted_hits.bam")
        done
        gp_replicates+=($(echo ${replicates[*]} | tr ' ' ','))
   done

You can see how these comma separated lists looks like by::  
 
   declare -p gp_replicates
   #printf "${gp_replicates[*]}"

Now we can run the Cuffdiff

::

   cuffdiff \
    --output-dir "$workingPath/cuffdiff_out" \
    --num-threads 2 \
    --multi-read-correct \
    --frag-bias-correct ${homo_sapiens_genome} \
    --labels ${groups[0]},${groups[1]} \
    $GTF_file  ${gp_replicates[0]}  ${gp_replicates[1]}

Cuffdiff usually requires high memory and would be more faster if you increased the no of threads
Check your computer resources before running it

Cuffdif will output a folder cuffdiff_out in the working directory. The folder caintains a lot of files. 
You need to read about it `here <http://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/cufflinks/cuffdiff/#cuffdiff-output-files>`__
