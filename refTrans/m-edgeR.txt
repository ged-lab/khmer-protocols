Differential expression by EdgeR
================================

.. shell start

We'll be using `edgeR
<http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/edgeR.html>`__
to do the basic differential expression analysis of our counts.

.. note:: This section reuires GNU R core installed with edgeR package installed

To run edgeR, you need to write a data loading and manipulation script in R. 
This script will load in all the studied samples, execute an MA plot, 
and provide a spreadsheet with differential expression of the studied tissues.
We will go togther step by step to understand and write this scrip through the command line

First, We need to combine all the count files of the studied samples into one dataset.
Also we need to classfy these samples into groups to compare them. In this case we will have 
two replicates for each studied tissue. This code this going to deals with your 
samples whatever the no of replicates and the studied groups. 
::

   echo "
   First_sample <- TRUE
   columnID <- 2
   group <- c()
   for (tophat_folder in dir(pattern='*_tophat')){
       file.name <- paste(tophat_folder, '/total_count.txt', sep='')
       sample.name <- sub('_tophat','',tophat_folder)
       if (First_sample){
           all.data <- read.delim(file.name, col.names=c('gene', sample.name), sep='\t', colClasses=c('character', 'numeric'), row.names=1)
           First_sample <- FALSE
       } else {
           temp <- read.delim(file.name, col.names=c('gene', sample.name), sep='\t', colClasses=c('character', 'numeric'), row.names=1)
           #all.data$sample.name <- temp$sample.name
           all.data[,columnID] <- temp[,1]
           colnames(all.data)[columnID] = sample.name
           columnID = columnID + 1
       }
       group_label <- sub('_repl[1-2]','', sample.name)
       group <- c(group,group_label)
   }" > edgeR_difExp.R

The count output of HTseqcount ends with five lines of summary statistics about the mapped reads.
So we need to the eliminate the last five rows in our dataset.
::

   echo "all.data <- all.data[1:(nrow(all.data)-5),]" >> edgeR_difExp.R
   
We now have a data frame with all the data in it. let us have an additional
line to show us the first few lines of our dataset:: 
   
   echo "head(all.data)" >> edgeR_difExp.R

It is time to load edgR package into memory o start working with
::   
   
   echo "library('edgeR')" >> edgeR_difExp.R

Now, it is time to calculte the differention expression. 
`edgeR <http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/edgeR.html>`__ 
has different functions for calculation of differential expression. 
We are using the 2 group comparison model. If you have more than 2 groups to compare, 
you will have to select the appropriate functions according to the edgR manual
::

   echo "
   dge = DGEList(counts=all.data, group=group)
   dge <- estimateCommonDisp(dge)
   dge <- estimateTagwiseDisp(dge)
   et <- exactTest(dge)
   etp <- topTags(et, n=100000)" >> edgeR_difExp.R

Let's add a line to have a quick view of the results ::
   
   echo "summary(etp\$table)" >> edgeR_difExp.R
   
We also can plot our results
::

   echo "
   etp\$table\$logFC = -etp\$table\$logFC
   pdf('edgeR-MA-plot.pdf')
   plot(
     etp\$table\$logCPM,
     etp\$table\$logFC,
     xlim=c(-3, 20), ylim=c(-12, 12), pch=20, cex=.3,
     col = ifelse( etp\$table\$FDR < .1, 'red', 'black' ) )
   dev.off()" >> edgeR_difExp.R

Finally we will write a spreadsheet with differential expression of the studied tissues
::

   echo "write.csv(etp\$table, 'edgeR-lung-vs-salivary.csv')" >> edgeR_difExp.R   

.. Note::

   you can copy the script from this link and save it in the working directory 
   under the name edgeR_difExp.R

   :doc:`./m-edgeR_difExp`


Now we can run the R script to do the analysis
::

   Rscript edgeR_difExp.R

This will produce two files, `edgeR-MA-plot.pdf
<http://2014-msu-rnaseq.readthedocs.org/en/latest/_static/subset/edgeR-MA-plot.pdf>`__
and `edgeR-lung-vs-salivary.csv
<http://2014-msu-rnaseq.readthedocs.org/en/latest/_static/subset/edgeR-lung-vs-salivary.csv>`__;
The last file consists of five columns: gene name, log fold change, P-value, and
FDR-adjusted P-value.
