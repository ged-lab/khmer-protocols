Differential expression
=======================

Now we have tried two different methods to summarize our expression: 
* The HTseq has summarized the raw reads per genes and now this ready for further analysis by Packages like DEseq and edgeR.
* Cufflinks has summarized the expression values as FPKM and now this is ready for further analysis by software like Cuffdif.

So now we are going to disscuss the differential expression analysis by these softwares:
